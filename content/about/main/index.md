intro: |
  Let me transport you somewhere: a desk that's sit in the top level of a barn...in the middle of the jungle...in Australia. This is where I realized my passion for statistics. 
  
  I was placed in Australia for my student teaching, and I had been teaching an upper-level statistics course at a private high school. Not only did I have to work through my confusion and befuddlement of binomial and hypergeometric distributions, or when to draw a tree diagram and when to draw a Karnaugh map; but, I had to work to gain a thorough level of understanding in order to teach this content to a class full of 11th graders. It was in this challenge--and working to overcome it--where my passion for statistics was born.
  
  Since then, I have been working to get my Masters. This passion began to extend from statistics to data analysis; then from data analysis to coding; then from coding to data visualization, regression, inference, and more. The idea that we can take a messy data set and turn it into something meaningful (whether it's through tidy data, inference, data visualization, Bayesian methods, regression, and more) truly captivates my attention.
